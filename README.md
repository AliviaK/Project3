# TaskList
Advanced JavaScript project 3 task list creator

This project uses the API: https://ghu8xhzgfe.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tasks to handle creating, storing, displaying, and deleting tasks for a particular user.
This project was created as a practice for making API requests and to demonstrate XML HTTP requests and callback hell as an alternative to JS Promises. Upoloaded for portfolio viewing.
